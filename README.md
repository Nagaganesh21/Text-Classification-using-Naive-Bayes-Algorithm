# Text-Classification-Application

## Introduction
Hello all, this project is my experiement with the Naive bayes classifier and implemented this by following the Simiplilearn's lecture, "Text Classification Using Naive Bayes | Naive Bayes Algorithm In Machine Learning " in Youtube. But what I did on my own is, to deploy the trained Naive bayes classifier model using Flask so that a user can use it through the front-end web application.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project was fetch_20newsgroups, imported from "sklearn.datasets". As the name suggests, this dataset contains articles which are classified into 20 news groups.
