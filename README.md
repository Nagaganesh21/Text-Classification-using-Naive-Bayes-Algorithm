# Text-Classification-Application

## Introduction
Hello all, this project is my experiement with the Naive bayes classifier and implemented this by following the Simiplilearn's lecture, <href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60pqgfT5tZM> "Text Classification Using Naive Bayes | Naive Bayes Algorithm In Machine Learning " </href> in Youtube. But what I did on my own is, to deploy the trained Naive bayes classifier model using Flask so that a user can use it through the front-end web application.
